## 1.1 Abstract
This project designs and implements a football club website with a clean interface and modern technologies to support both administrators and coaches. Core features include plan management, player data, team rosters, recruitment, transfers, and more. Based on user needs, the system uses a front-end/back-end separation architecture:**Spring Boot**for the back end, **Vue.js** for the front end, and **MySQL** as the database. The website underwent thorough testing to ensure stability and security. It also supports future expansion, such as data analysis and smart recommendations, offering a user-friendly and efficient management platform for the club.Keywords: **Spring Boot, Java, MySQL, Football Club**
## 1.2 Function Implementation
This website implements basic functionality through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). For example, in the Department Management Module, there are two functions: managing departments and adding new departments. In the "Add" section, administrators can input the department type, department name, and other specific information. In the "Manage" section, administrators can search for department information using department personnel names and department types, and the search results will be displayed on the interface. Additionally, this information can be edited, detailed, or deleted as needed.
